# Dog-Breed-Classifier
Convolutional Neural Networks

Project goal
The goal of this project is to create a dog breed identification application using convolutional neural networks. The resulting algorithm could be used as part of a mobile or web app. The code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of the finished project.

In this real-world setting, we will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.
